Note
Subject: Algorithmic Trading - Machine Learning & Quant Strategies

Challenges to applying ML in trading:
(Reflexivity)
- hard to predict returns or prices.
- quite hard to predict return signs.
- hard to predict economic indicator.
- Not so hard to predict volatility.

Workflow Process
1. Collect and prepare the data
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy
3. Coding the model: train and test the model (machine learning in trading)
4. Backtest the strategy

Project 1: Unsupervised Learning Trading Strategy 

Unsupervised Learning in Trading
- using machine learning techniques to analyze financial data without any labeled or predefined target variable.
- focuses on extracting insights from data

Here's how unsupervised learning is applied in trading:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Market Regime Detection
- Portfolio Optimization

Do
1. Download SP500 stocks prices Data
2. Calculate technical indicators and features
3. Aggregate on monthly level and filter (only top 150 most liquid stocks)
4. Calculate monthly returns
5. Download Fama-French factors and calculate rolling
6. K-means clustering model
7. select assets based on the cluster
8. Visualize the portfolio returns and compare to SP500 returns

Project 2: Twitter Sentiment Investing Strategy

focuses on analyzing how people feel about stocks, industries, market. (public sentiment)

Do
1. Download NASDAQ stocks twitter sentiment data.
2. Calculate a quantitative feature of the engagement ratio in Twitter of each stock. 
3. Every month rank all stocks and construct an equal-weight portfolio.
4. Compare it against NASDAQ performance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project 3: Intraday Strategy Using GARCH Model

use technical analysis, real-time data, and risk management techniques to make quick decisions, aiming to capitalize on market volatility.

Do
1. Load simulated daily data and simulated 5-min data.
2. Define fn to fit GARCH model and predict 1-day ahead volatility in a rolling window.
3. Calculate prediction premium and form a daily signal from it.
4. Merge with intraday data and calculate intraday indicators to form the intraday signal.
5. Generate the position entry and hold until the end of the day.
6. Calculate final strategy returns.
