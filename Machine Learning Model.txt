# Machine Learning

## Here are some Topics:

- Model
1. Arima (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
model Stat
predict data: time series data
data: trend, seasonal
concept: try to remove noise from time series to reduce error
model = ARIMA(p,d,q)
p = lag time
d = Stationary of data >> data: mean and variance(consistent)
q = ma >> lag time (lag time of error)
optimum order(p,d,q)
model.fit()
MSE

2. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
machine learning model
predict data: Classification, regression
forecast: time

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Neural Network - deep learning
predict data: (forecast) time series data
